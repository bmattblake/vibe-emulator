          The worst part about all of this is that it's clear to anyone with a brain that what they're doing has the opposite effect. Their hysteria and attacks are making things worse. This isn't a conspiracy. It's a political fact. Quite unrelated to anything else they say or do.

          The worst part about all this nonsense is that it creates a hysteria where people don’t actually look at the actual data. In fact, the covid data actually shows rapid improvements in all 3 measures starting in 2016: https://t.co/jKpEt8wTMS
