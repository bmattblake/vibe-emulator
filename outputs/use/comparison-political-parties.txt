          I think Republicans are trying to keep this race out of the hands of Berniecrats. 
          They understand that if they can nominate someone who can win in FL then they won't 
          have to worry about any other state. FL will be the ceiling.

          I think Republicans do this because it seriously works. I understand the appeal.

          I think Republicans are under such heavy pressure to deliver for the American 
          people by meeting our massive public needs that they may be quite amenable to taking up some of our @JaredPolisi and @JasonHelsov filibuster-proof bill. Let's see what they have to say about it.

          I think Republicans believe the best way to get good legislation passed is to 
          pass the best legislation. Democrats believe the best way to get good legislation 
          passed is to pass the best legislation.

          I think Republicans would actually have a somewhat easy time creating a 
          national Democratic party if 
          they really wanted to

Output for model curie:ft-personal:tuckercarlson-2022-04-21-00-47-52:

          I think Democrats are getting way too smart for the Republican Party. The 
          Republicans are dropping the ball because they don't recognize the long game being 
          played by Democrats.

          I think Democrats should be utterly unequivocal in their condemnation of such a

          I think Democrats have got to face the reality that for the foreseeable future, 
          Republicans are going to have a supermajority in the House and Senate — and that means 
          they control the agenda.

          I think Democrats would do well to consider turning the NSC - otherwise known as 
          the Napoleon Complex Council - into some kind of communication tool. Like, a 
          liaison where people could go and complain that they cant figure out if they're a 
          Pilot, a Gunner, or an operator
